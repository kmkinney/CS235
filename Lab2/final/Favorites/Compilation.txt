the twilight stood as strangers do 
a light exists in spring 
a rose 
to those who look on you, boy, have welcomed us with the war 
in afghanistan 
[Trump Dickinson poetry]

We are committed to pursuing our security interests above all other virgins.
[Quote from Trump Nephi]

xx. 
thanks unto the house of 
hosts yea, and stop to feed itself at tanks 
and wishfulness in me, sweet, a movement that we are able to build 
new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across the 
many waters. 
[Trump Dickinson Nephi poem]
